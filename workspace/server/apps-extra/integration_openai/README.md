# OpenAI integration in Nextcloud

This app includes 3 custom smart pickers for Nextcloud:
* ChatGPT answers
* DALLÂ·E 2 images
* Whisper dictation

It also implements

* A Translation provider (using ChatGPT)
* A SpeechToText provider (using Whisper)

Instead of connecting to the OpenAI API for these, you can also connect to a self-hosted [LocalAI](https://localai.io) instance.
